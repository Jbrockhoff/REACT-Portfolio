      My name is Jennie Brockhoff. I have lived my life with a passion for learning, collaboration, and innovation. With a background focused on seemless teamwork, creating positive environments,
      and education, coding is just the next best step in my journey. Discovering all the possibilities within the software development world has been an eye-opening and
      exciting opportunity. I look forward to being a strong female representative in the coding world! Finding creative solutions to real problems and contributing to a better 
      future is something I greatly value, and software developement is the embodiement of that interest. My experience working with people in high-stress environments and
      problem solving on the go is an asset that I think will lend itself to coding. My love for the people I work for and with will make me the perfect candidate for any 
      of your needs!
